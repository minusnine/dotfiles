# Dotfiles

## Installation:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minusnine/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh -sSf | sh
```

## TODO

* Make less dependencies on fetching a script from a random URL and executing
  it blindly.
* Handle support for additional, private dotfiles
* Do better validation of the configuration file to protect against malicious
	CLI inputs.
